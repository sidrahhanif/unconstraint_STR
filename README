The instructions to execute the code are as follows:
$HOME is a directory where the code you place the folder “Word_detection_STR_product”
## Aanaconda
After logging in, install Anaconda 3:

``` sh
cd /tmp
curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2019.03-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

## Environment

Create the environment defined in `environment.yaml`.
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml --name hwr
cd word_detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda activate hwr
```

## Execution

### Sample images
The sample images are placed in the folder:
$HOME./Word_detection_STR_product/word_detection/test_STR_images/images/. The results for these sample placed at the home path with suffix “results_” image name. For example, the results for image “d04-257” are saved in image file “results_d04-257.jpg”


## Trajectory Recovery
[Recommended] Run the file “execute.sh”, it will produce all the results.
Step-by-step guide to run code:
1)	Place the handwriting text image in folder $HOME./Word_detection_STR_product/word_detection/test_STR_images/images/

2)	cd ./word_detection/

3)	Execute the command python /$HOME /Word_detection_STR_product/word_detection/yolov5_test_STR_Signed.py --source $HOME/Word_detection_STR_product/word_detection/test_STR_images/images/
	This will save word into directory word_detection/runs/detect/exp/
4)	Execute command python stroke_recovery_offline.py
5)	Change the image-name in file merge_words_full_page.py to visualize the results.
By default , it is ‘d04-257.
